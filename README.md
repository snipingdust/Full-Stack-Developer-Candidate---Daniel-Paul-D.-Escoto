To activate the database (MSSQL) you must:
1. Put the BowlingGame/DB directory to your ProgramData Folder found in Publish folder.
2. Install MSSQL database on your computer if you do not have one. (https://www.microsoft.com/en-pk/download/details.aspx?id=56840)
3. Create a database named "Bowling" using MSSQL. Preferably SQL Management Server Studio.
4. Run both sql scripts bowlers_table and bowling_games_table. 
5. Edit the datasource (username for windows), initial catalog (the database name: "Bowling"), username and password in the properties file, dbBowlingGame.properties.
6. Install the published file to run the application.
